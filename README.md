## #Microsoft Movie Studios 
## Business Problem
Microsoft Studios wants to start the production of films. In order to do so they reached out to me and they asked me to give them some recommendations so that they can be successful in doing so. They want to keep their shareholders happy and they want to convince them that investing in the production of films will be a great investment. By analyzing the data I will have a better understanding on how to better mold and finalize the recommendations that I will be providng to Microsoft Studios.
## Data Understanding 
Movies have been around for a very long time. The data bases that I will be working with include movies that have been released in the 1900's up to the 2000's. In addition to the movie title, other information about the film such as the release date, popularity of the movie, etc. are also included. 
## Exploratory Data Analysis 
1. What studio had the greatest total gross earnings?
- Dreamworks / Pixar and Buena Vista had the greatest total gross earnings.

2. What type of relationship is there between production budget and total gross earnings?
- The data showed that if you have a production budget of at least $150 million then you are placed on a spot in where you are less likely to break even. 

3. What month of release date had the greatest gross earnings?
- Releasing movies during the summer time showed that that was the time in which total gross earning was the highest. 

## Conclusions / Recommendations
This analysis leads to three recommendations for increasing Microsoft's gross earnings :
1. Releasing films in the summertime would be beneficial for Microsoft Studios. According to the line/bar graph (Production Budget vs. Gross Earnings) that was constructed, there was a clear peak in gross earnings without the need to produce various films. 
2. Based on the bar graph (Amount of Films Produced by Studios) Pixar/ Dreamworks & Buena Vista Studios notably were the top two studios with the greatest amount of gross earnings. Partnering up with these studios would be a smart move in order to increase our profits at Microsoft Studios.
3. Having a production budget of at least $150 million sets the company in a "sweet spot" per say, in where they would be at a much lower risk of breaking even and instead generate revenue. 
## Next Steps 
Further analyses could yield additional insights to further increase Microsoft's gross earnings:
1. If I would have had more time to analyze the data, I would dig deeper and find what correlation there is between the genre of the movie and the amount of revenue that it generated. 
2. Additionally, I would also take a closer look at how the movie directors contribute to the success of the movies being produced. 
3. Lastly, I would try to narrow down the metrics that I used so that it instead of taking into account the movies released in the early 1900's to early 2000's, I would only be focusing on those released during the 2000's.
